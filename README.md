# VertexAlgebrasinSage

This package contains code to work with operator product expansions in vertex algebras using various special cases of Borcherds' identity, but mostly the noncommutative Wick formula. 

It contains two Jupyer notebooks of examples of free field realizations of affine $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, and the documentation in the code contains a number of additional helpful examples.
